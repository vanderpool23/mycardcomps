        <p>Please note, we are in the development phase of this project. We are currently manually verifying our comps as part of the development process. It may take up to 48 hours for you to receive your comp'd value.</p>
        <p>Also, while this system is designed for all sports cards, our initial product offering is being fine-tuned for hard-to-comp cards. Currently, the model is being refined for cards in the $50 to $1000 USD price range.</p>
        <p>We are not a grading service. We do not ask for images of your cards and trust that your text inputs are enough information for us to find comps for your card.</p>
